# test_scrolling_background
A simple background scrolling program.

I didn't look up any extensive video tutorials on how to make a scrolling background. I just used what I learned to figure it out. (Although I used stack overflow every time I ran into an error) I learned more about using classes with pygame, how to target the last item in a list, and how to set variables in a class that all instances will use.

To run this, all you have to do is have the .py and background.png files in the same folder and run the .py. Or you could just clone the repository. To be honest I didn't know that was a thing until now. Even learn how to add a requirements.txt in case someone is too lazy to install one module. Overall this is a nice exercise since I haven't done any coding in a couple days. Is there anything I could've done better with the program?
